### XIAParameterEditor

The XIAParameterEditor is a small tool that can be used to change the values in a settings file. Note that this will change the actual binary value of the parameter. Use with care, as there are no "sanity check", etc. to make sure that you change something that shouldnt be changed. For the average user, some other tool would be more suitable.
