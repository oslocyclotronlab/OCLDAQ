/*! \namespace HardwareRegistry
 *
 * The HardwareRegistry namespace is where information about all known
 * DDAS modules are stored. The information that the user can access
 * in this namespace's functions is not specific to a module but rather
 * to a hardware type. If the user wants to know basic information about
 * the adc resolution or frequency, this namespace will scratch that itch.
 * However, if the user is looking for information about the serial number,
 * this is not the place for that. In fact, there currently is no place for that.
 *
 * The HardwareRegistry is fairly simple. It is just a map of HardwareRegistry::HardwareSpecifications
 * that are keyed by HardwareRegistry::HardwareType enumerations. The HardwareRegistry
 * provides a default state that provides the normal specifications for each
 * hardware type in use at the NSCL. If for some crazy reason, something changes,
 * the user can change the specifications associated with each device type.
 *
 *
 * There is also a function to determine the hardware type enumeration value
 * given the hardware revision, adc frequency, and adc resolution called
 * HardwareRegistry::computeHardwareType(). The reverse operation is called
 * HardwareRegistry::getSpecification(HardwareType type). Together these
 * two functions are probably the most useful tools.

     * \brief The HardwareType enum
     *
     * The HardwareType enumeration provides an identifier for each type
     * of hardware that might be found in the system. The user can determine
     * which hardware type they are dealing with by calling the
     * Pixie16ReadModuleInfo() methods to access the ADC sampling frequency,
     * the ADC resolution, and the hardware revision. Together with those
     * three pieces of information, it is possible to determine the
     * appropriate HardwareType.
     *
     *
     * \todo Create a method that can query a module and compute
     *       the HardwareType.
